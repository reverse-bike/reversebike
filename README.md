The Super73 Reverse Engineered project provides comprehensive service documentation for Super73's fat tire e-bikes. The initial focus will be on the R-series and S-series.

Super73 provides very minimal documentation; what exists is focused on use. Their limited warranty discourages modification or disassembly. Many parts are common but with proprietary connections, creating intentional incompatibilities.

This project aims to exercise the [right to repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) by guiding anyone with foundational bicycle knowledge willing to learn more and maintain their e-bike. The ability to repair and maintain extends the life and enjoyment of the e-bike, is economically and ecologically sound, and is incredibly satisfying.
